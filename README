Speedycracker is a duet of two scripts, one shell and one python for the
purpose of recovering WPA passwords from Thomson/Speedtouch wifi modem/routers.

The python script can be run on itself without requiring the rainbow table,
but its a bit slow and it cannot find all possible combinations

The shell script uses the rainbow table, its very fast and it can find
all possible combinations.

Both of them are released under the GPL v2 Licence.

To use the scripts follow the instructions bellow.


1) Make both scripts executables:

chmod +x {speedycracker,speedycracker.py}


2) Usage:

2.a) Rainbow table script:

./speedycracker

and type your 6-digit part of the SSID]

2.b) Python script:

./speedycracker.py <SSID>

Example:

./speedycracker.py 1547A0
