Speedycracker is a script duet, one shell and one python for the purpose
of recovering WPA passwords from Thomson/Speedtouch wifi modem/routers.

The python script can be run on itself without requiring the rainbow table,
but its a bit slow and it cannot find all possible combinations.

The shell script uses the rainbow table, its very fast even on old
computers and it can find all possible combinations.

Both of them are released under the GPL v2 Licence.

Note: It is compatible with Backtrack 5+ and other modern Linux
distributions.

To use the scripts follow the instructions bellow.


1) Make both scripts executables:

chmod +x {speedycracker,speedycracker.py}


2) Usage:

2.a) Rainbow table script:

./speedycracker

and type your 6-digit part of the SSID

2.b) Python script:

./speedycracker.py <SSID>

Example:
